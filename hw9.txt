1.  SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is used for managing and manipulating relational databases.

    Relational databases are databases that store and provide access to data points that are related to one another. They are 
    structured to recognize relations among stored items of information.

4.  PDO stands for PHP Data Objects. It is a database access layer providing a uniform method of access to multiple databases.

    Prepared statements are used to enhance security and improve performance. They prevent SQL injection attacks and reduce 
    parsing time as the SQL statement template is created only once.
